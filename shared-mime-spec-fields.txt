Document Metadata

For documents, applications have typically used a mixture of Dublin Core types and propriety types. In order to be consistent with them, we have based our metadata names likewise. We have also based these names on metadata names found in Open Office, Ms Word and PDF documents. All metadata in this section is prefixed with the "Doc" class and any other document based metadata should also have this prefix (unless it is application specific). All the metadata here is not editable through the interface as all of it is derived from the file contents.

For images, most support the EXIF standard and so this largely makes up this specification. SVG files have user definable non-standard metadata so a subset of Dublin Core is also provided here. All metadata in this section is prefixed with the "Image" class and any other image based metadata should also have this prefix (unless it is application specific). All the metadata here is not editable through the interface as all of it is derived from the file contents.
